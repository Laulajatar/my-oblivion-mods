# My Graphic Settings

![Example Image](image.png)

This is just a dump to throw my settings in here for the 0.1 people who might be interested in it.   
Unfortunately I can't use ENB atm, so OR and vkBasalt gotta do the job. 

## Oblivion Reloaded Settings

Those are for OR 6.5.   
Yes, I still use 6.5, sue me.   
I am not interested in changing to a more recent version until the day a Camera Command replacement is made.   
Be aware, I changed the OR menu key to numpad /


## vkBasalt Settings

Those are for vkBasalt (who would've thought). 
It uses shaders from this repo https://github.com/crosire/reshade-shaders
FilmGrain2 is included, because I edited it to remove the movement of the grain pixels. 
All shader paths would have to be adjusted to your system.

## Sunglare

I added a lens flare to the vanilla sunglare because I can't use ENB currently and I miss it. It's just a static image, not as nice as ENB's effect.
