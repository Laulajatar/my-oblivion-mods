This is just a dump to throw my settings in here for the 0.1 people who might be interested in it.   
Unfortunately I can't use ENB atm, so OR and vkBasalt gotta do the job. 

# Oblivion Reloaded Settings

Those are for OR 6.5.   
Yes, I still use 6.5, sue me. 
Be aware, I changed the OR menu key to numpad /


# vkBasalt Settings

Those are for vkBasalt (who would've thought). 
It uses shaders from this repo https://github.com/crosire/reshade-shaders
FilmGrain2 is included, because I edited it to remove the movement of the grain pixels. 
All shader paths would have to be adjusted to your system.
