# This looks Familiar

![Example Image](image.png)

This mod adds a spell to the game which summons a permanent familiar. If the familiar dies, it can be resummoned. Sneaking while activating it offers some options, among others to change the familiar's appearance or level it up, if your skill is high enough.     

The spell can be found in a random Ayledi ruin, by reading a book, or optionally recieved at game start. Some of the familiar forms might be a bit OP on level 1, though. 

Comes with custom spell icon if CSI updated is installed.
