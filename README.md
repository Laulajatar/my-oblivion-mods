# This is where I would put my mods in progress

If I had the patience to actually work on anything.    

If you actually happen to find this, it's "use at your own risk" territory. Stuff might be in all stages from "raw idea" to "fully working but not willing to deal with people and release it". I'll try to mark known problems here, but be warned. 

**If both, a bsa and loose files exist, only one is needed.**


## A Rainbow of Treasaures - New Gems & Gem Dust

Adds 7 new gems to the game, and gemdust for all 12 gems (7 + 5 vanilla) as well as pearl dust.     
The new gems are amethyst (purple), spinel (pink), aquamarine (light blue), onyx (black), peridot (light green), citrine (yellow) and tourmaline (cyan). The dust can be used for alchemy. 
Considering compatibility to other gem mods, but has low priority as they usually have their own grinding mechanic.

**This mod has been released.**


## Ambient Dungeons

Changes the ambient light of a couple of Ayleid ruins to be slightly tinted. It's not randomized, so all interiors belonging to one ruin will have the same color. Recommended to import C.lights and NoMerge the rest in Wrye Bash.   
*Current issues:* None.


## Birthsigns

Just a personal rebalance of birthsigns/race abilities, loosely inspired by bgBalance.   
*Current issues:* None.


## Bookworm

Update of the Bookworm mod, using ConScribe to make it possible to sync the read progress across several played characters. No known issues, but as I don't play mutiple characters (or, uh, play at all tbh) it's not tested.  
*Current issues:* Not really an issue, I just don't play multiple chars so I can't test the sync feature.   

**This mod has been released.**


## Calm Water

Some pathetic attempt at more clear and transparent water, some very clear mountain lakes, some tinted interior waters as well as green swamp water. Not compatible with UL. As with all water transparencies, at the ocean (or other huge water bodies) it will look weird outside the rendered cells.   
*Current issues:* It's still Oblivion water, it looks like shit.


## Conjured Bows have Conjured Arrows

This mod gives every actor that summons a bow a quiver of 50 Bound Arrows if they have no arrows equipped when casting the spell. 

**This mod has been released.**


## CTAddPose Custom ESP

To be used with this tutorial [Making your own one-mod pose collection](http://www.shrine-of-kynareth.de/making-your-own-one-mod-pose-collection).

**This resource has been released.**


# Custom Map Marker Overhaul Icons

What it says on the tin.


## Display Skill Perk Effects

This mod adds detailed perk descriptions in skill tooltips. Supports some mods adding custom perks and customized texts. 

**This mod has been released.**


## Dynamically Adjusted Darkness

Uses a script (similar to the one in MOO) that changes the darkness of nights. Could also be used to make them brighter, but too low source values (example: NAO) result in a weird tint. 
Can be disabled for SI and Tamriel independently. The SI check uses GetPlayerInSEWorld, so just porting there to test won't work and everytime the value is not set, the script will assume the player is in Tamriel.  
*Current issues:* None.


## Fog of War

Small plugin that adds a fog distance of 8000 to all weathers. 
Was a request on reddit. For players who don't like how the lod looks and basically prefer a smaller draw distance.    
*Current issues:* None that I know of.


## Get rid of small Souls

This mod allows you to remove souls from soul gems. Right clicking on any soul gem in your inventory opens a container. Drop the soul gems you want to empty in there, close your inventory and wait a moment. You will recieve empty soul gems. 

**This mod has been released.**


## Hudless Screenshot Key

Remove interface, take screenshot, put interface back, with one keypress.

**This mod has been released.**


## Interesting Locations

There's nothing to see here. Not interesting.   
No for real, this has just started and it's not playable.


## Let there be Flowers

This mod adds some flowers to a few ground textures. For this to work as intended, it's necessary to raise the grass limit per texture (iMaxGrassTypesPerTexure) in the Oblivion ini - 5 should be more than enough. You can find your ini in My Documents\My Games\Oblivion. With the vanilla limit of 2, some flowers just won't show up.

**This mod has been released.**


## Morrowind-like Health

This mod makes it so waiting no longer regenerates all health at once. It regenerates health by 10% Endurance per hour, like in Morrowind. 

**This mod has been released.**


## Morrowind-like Leveling

Allows you to keep increasing skills for attribute bonuses before going to sleep, even after the game told you you are ready to level up. Can optionally allow minor and spec skills to have impact on leveling, too. Can optionally make luck level and fame/infamy dependent. Can optionally implement retroactive health.   
Should be fully functional on new game, will react unpredictable if adding to a running game with outstanding levelups (just don't), might react unpredictable if leveling in tutorial too much (gotta check how it behaves at the gate, perhaps just suspend until player exists).   
*Current issues:* If letting the mod calculate luck, it is still possible to raise luck at levelup, this point will be instantly lost afterwards. 


## Morrowind-like Magicka

This mod stops Magicka regeneration. You'll have to rest, wait or use potions/absorb to regain Magicka, like in Morrowind. Optionally turn on Willpower/Intelligence only based regeneration. 

**This mod has been released.**


## Move while Encumbered

Let's you still walk (not run) while encumbered, FO3 style. Is a bit hacky, might not always work, and doesn't work on controller, sadly. Unlikely to ever change.


## Nameless Overhaul

Close to vanilla overhaul that keeps a lot of vanilla scaling but puts an end to endless leveling enenmies and bandits in glass armor. Includes some quality of life features like artifact upgrading and simple bandage/lockpick crafting.  
*Current Issues:* Balancing untested on level 15+. 


## Respawning Ayleid Stones

Replaces Ayleid stones on pickup with a new one that will respawn in (ini set) intervals. No known issues. Since it uses PlaceAtMe, check uninstall instructions if you ever want to uninstall.   
*Current issues:* None.


## Shivering Weather mixed up

Takes a few of the unused vanilla shivering isles weathers and puts them into the rotation.
Mania/Dementia weather isn't clearly divided anymore, chances for the corresponding weathers are higher in the right region, but all weathers can happen everywhere.    
Nights are roughly 50% darker.   
    
**This mod has been released.**


## Sinderion's Serendipity

If you've managed to find & hand in 100 Nirnroots, you will acquire the perk "Sinderion's Serendipity" which gives a chance to create two potions instead of one when performing alchemy. 

**This mod has been released.**


## Skill Based Harvest Chance

Makes the harvest chance of plants dependent on Alchemy and Luck, while keeping the original chance as a base value. See ini for configuration.  

**This mod has been released.**


## Sort you Stuff

This mod lets you sort items into every container that is safe for storage and either player-owned or unowned. It is possible to retrieve magic items (ingredients, scrolls, potions and sigil stones) by effect. 

**This mod has been released.**


## Staffs give Experience

Casting spells from staff gives experience to the school of the most expensive part of the enchantment.   
*Current issues*: Need to check how Fundament works and perhaps give it the same treatment as CMP.


## This looks Familiar

Adds a spell that summons a permanent familiar with a ghostly look. It can be leveled up by giving it a Welkynd Stone, not higher than player level as well as Mysticism/2, whatever is lowest. A lvl 14 player with Mysticism 20 could have a lvl 10 Familiar. Will sometimes find items when idle.   
*Current issues:* The water walking ability sometimes bugs out and generally, the ghostly effect bugs out when walking on water. Probably engine things.   


## Traveler's Tent

This version is adding some further development/fixes without proper time for testing, which has not been added to the nexus version yet. Currently:    
- Replaces Moveto command on tent interaction with a real door. 
- Fixes the local map showing dummy interiors I used for decorating.
- Added the scripted spell failsafe from this [article](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/articles/44458/) to the mark companion spell.
- Added a quest to attempt to prevent the vanishing tent bug
    
**This mod has been released.**


## Used Old Map for Shivering Isles

I've always used the Old Map or Improved Used Map for my Cyrodiil map and I was missing a similar option for the Shivering Isles, so I made one (or six). 

**This mod has been released.**
