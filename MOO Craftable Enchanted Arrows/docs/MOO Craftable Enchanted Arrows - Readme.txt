I'm a bit lazy right now, so a short readme has to do: 


Description
-----------

This "mod" adds 112 enchanted arrows that are crafted with MOO's crafting feature. 
It's 4 levels of enchantments (5, 10, 15 and 20/2sec damage) of each shock, frost, fire and poison, for each material of iron, steel, silver, elven, glass and ebony). They are crafted with the same recipe normal arrows are crafted with MOO, but take those potions you get from disarming traps to create enchanted versions. The power of the enchantment depends on the power of the poison. Since it's not possible to craft dwarven and daedric arrows with MOO, there are no enchanted variants either. 

If you have no metal at hand, you can also create stone arrows (also unenchanted version available) that's even weaker than iron arrows. 

The arrows are crafted with the fletching jig. Materials needed are feathers, shafts, arrow heads (or stone for the stone arrow) and a poison from disarming traps.


Install
-------

Drop the esp into your data folder. Load order doesn't matter, doesn't have to load after MOO. 

Copy the contents of the file Add this to Maskar's Oblivion Overhaul for craft recipes.ini.txt - you might have guessed it - into Maskar's Oblivion Overhaul for craft recipes.ini. Can just drop it at the end. Do not delete anything from the ini, do not replace the ini, just add the contents of my file at the end.
