# MOO Craftable Enchanted Arrows

![Example Image](image.jpg)

This "mod" adds 112 enchanted arrows that are crafted with MOO's crafting feature.  
It's 4 levels of enchantments (5, 10, 15 and 20/2sec damage) of each shock, frost, fire and poison, for each material of iron, steel, silver, elven, glass and ebony). They are crafted with the same recipe normal arrows are crafted with MOO, but take those potions you get from disarming traps to create enchanted versions. The power of the enchantment depends on the power of the poison. Since it's not possible to craft dwarven and daedric arrows with MOO, there are no enchanted variants either.
