Shivering Isles Weather Mixed Up
A modifcation for Oblivion with patch 1.2.0416 by Laulajatar.
Version 1.0

Description
-----------

I got a bit bored with the few weathers that exist in SI. Mania and Dementia each get only like 2-4 weathers and while Dementia has more, most of them have fog. This mod:

- Allows for Mania weather to happen on the Dementia side of SI and vice versa. Chances are higher for native weather. 
- Takes a two more weathers and adds them to the rotation.
  There are now 3 clear weathers, 2 overcast weathers, 2 foggy weathers and 2 rainy/stormy weathers.
- Changes some of the existing weathers slightly.
- Makes nights roughly 50% darker.
- Uses only vanilla textures. If you use any replacers, those will be used. 

What this mod doesn't do:
- Add new weather records. I reused some vanilla records that looked unused, because I wanted this mod to be mergeable.
  I sure hope they were really unused. I couldn't find references to them in any scripts or regions.
- Add new textures. 



Requirements
------------

Surprisingly, this mod requires Shivering Isles.



Conflicts
---------

Other weather mods that change the weather of Shivering Isles will conflict. I know only of Enhanced Weather and All Natural.
I am pretty sure Enhanced Weather can be used for Tamriel only and will not touch SI in that case, not sure about All Natural. If AN still script-controls the weather, even without adding new types, it will conflict.
Honestly, if you use AN, just use AN's SI weather. 



Installation
------------

Copy the contents of the archive into the Oblivion\Data Folder.
Activate the .esp in a game launcher of your choice.
Can be merged into the bashed patch.



Uninstallation
--------------

This mod will not make permanent changes to your savegame, it can be uninstalled at any time. 
Since all the weathers exist in vanilla, no precautions are necessary. The weather just might look funny until the next natural weather change, if you are in SI.
