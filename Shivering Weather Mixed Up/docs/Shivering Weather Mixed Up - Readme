Shivering Isles Weather Mixed Up
A modifcation for Oblivion with patch 1.2.0416 by Laulajatar.
Version 1.0

Description
-----------

I got a bit bored with the few weathers that exist in SI. Mania and Dementia each get only like 2-3 weathers and so many of those have fog. This mod: 

- Allows for Mania weather to happen on the Dementia side of SI and vice versa. Chances are higher for native weather. 
- Takes a few more weathers and adds them to the rotation.
  There are now 3 clear weathers, 2 overcast weathers, 2 foggy weathers and 2 rainy/stormy weathers. 
- Changes some of the existing weathers slightly. Most notably, there is now less fog, unless the weather is foggy.
- Makes nights roughly 50% darker. 
- Uses only vanilla textures. If you use any replacers, those will be used. 

What this mod doesn't do: 
- Add new weather records. I reused some vanilla records that looked unused, because I wanted this mod to be mergeable. 
- Add new textures. 
- Do drastic changes to the lighting. Well at least I hope so. I attempted to keep the vanilla mood mostly. 



Conflicts
---------
Other weather mods that change the weather of Shivering Isles. I know only of Enhanced Weather and All Natural. 
As far as I am aware, both versions can be used for Tamriel only. I am pretty sure Enhanced Weather really doesn't touch SI in that case, not sure about All Natural. If AN still script-controls the weather, even without adding new types, it will conflict. 
Honestly, if you use AN, just use AN's SI weather. 



Installation
------------

Copy the contents of the archive into the Oblivion\Data Folder.
Activate the .esp in a game launcher of your choice.
Can be merged into the bashed patch.



Uninstallation
--------------

This mod will not make permanent changes to your savegame, it can be uninstalled at any time. 
Since all the weathers exist in vanilla, no precautions are necessary. The weather just might look funny until the next natural weather change, if you are in SI.
