HUDless Screenshot Key

A modifcation for Oblivion with patch 1.2.0416 by Laulajatar.
Version 1.0


Description
-----------

This mod turns F12 into a key to take a screenshot without the HUD. It will disable the HUD, take the screenshot, enable the HUD again and save the Oblivion.ini, all in a few frames. It's because I'm too lazy to type "tm" into the console, yea. Saving the ini is done so you don't lose the screenshot index if the game crashes. 

You can change the key by entering into the console: Set HudlessScreenshotKey to 88
Where you can replace 88 with any key from this nice list: https://cs.elderscrolls.com/index.php?title=IsKeyPressed3

The script runs "only" once every 0.1 seconds, sp a super fast tap on the F12 key might not trigger it.



Known Issues
------------

You must be able to take screenshots normally, i.e. it must be enabled in your Oblivion.ini file (bAllowScreenShot=1) & pressing "Print" must create a screenshot. 

There is probably not a single line in this script that works with Oblivion Reloaded. Don't use it with OR. OR already takes HUDless screenshots. 



Requirements
------------

This mod requires the Oblivion Script Extender (OBSE)
