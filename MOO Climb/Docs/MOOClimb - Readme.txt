Maskarâ€™s Climbing Standalone

A modifcation for Oblivion with patch 1.2.0416.
Requires OBSE
Version 1.0



Description
-----------

Ages ago, someone on Reddit aske for a way to extract only this feature, so I extracted it. The person uploaded the mod to nexus, but apparently, that one's gone now, so I might as well throw it up here.

You can disable climbing for NPCs or Player in the console:

set MaskarsClimbNPC to 0
set MaskarsClimbPlayer to 0

0 will deactivate either one.
Set back to 1 to activate.

Changing settings for NPCs during a fight might not work as expected, i.e. turning it off will have instant effect, but turning it on will only work for actors entering combat.



Installation
------------

Copy the contents of the archive into the Oblivion\Data Folder. 
Activate the .esp in a game launcher of your choice.

This mod ABSOLUTELY needs OBSE. 

This mod will not store anything in your savegame, it can be uninstalled at every time.
