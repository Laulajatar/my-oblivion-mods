Conjured Bows have Conjured Arrows

A modifcation for Oblivion with patch 1.2.0416 by Laulajatar.
Version 1.1


Description
-----------

This mod gives every actor that summons a bow (using the normal Bound Bow spell effect - including mod added & selfmade spells) a quiver of 50 Bound Arrows IF they have no arrows equipped when casting the spell. 
On the player, the arrows will be automatically equipped. Unequipping them dismisses them. 

Their strength is equal to Silver Arrows. I didn't want to make them too weak, or you'd still feel the need to lug a bunch of low level arrows around, but I also didn't want them to be better than the more rare arrows. 

They cannot be dropped, sold, deposited or retrieved from enemies, they vanish from the game world almost instantly and should you ever manage to somehow pick one up when you have no Bound Bow equipped, it will dissolve back into Oblivion after a few seconds.



Known Issues
------------

As all script mods, this mod will take a few seconds after game start to initialize. If you summon a bow in those seconds, you will not get arrows. If you load a game where you have a bow and put it away in those seconds, it will take a moment for the arrows to disappear. This is an engine limitation.



Requirements
------------

This mod requires the Oblivion Script Extender (OBSE)
