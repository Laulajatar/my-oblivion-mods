A Familiar Mod

A modifcation for Oblivion with patch 1.2.0416 by Laulajatar.
Requires OBSE
Version 1.0



Description
-----------

This mod lets you summon a permanent familiar that will follow you until it dies or is dismissed. 



How to use
----------

At game start, the book to learn the spell from will be placed randomly in one of 3 Ayleid ruins. It will be placed on top of a stone block beside a large Ayleid chest, usually in a boss room. 

You can also enable in the ini that the spell will be added to you on game start. In this case, no books can be found. 

By default, the summon spell belongs to the school of Mysticism. You can change it to Conjuration in the ini. Whatever you chose, the max level of your familiar is limited to either your level or the level of the school/2, whatever is lower. 

To access the commands crouch and activate your familiar. You can change the shape it takes, command it to follow or wait and level it up, if you have a welkynd stone and your level/skill is high enough. 



Known Issues
------------ 

The transparency of the ghost effect will behave weirdly when walking over water. In certain angles the creature might become fully transparent. This is just cosmetical.
Similarly, when other effect shaders are played on the familiars, they turn invisible for a moment. 



Installation
------------

Copy the contents of the archive into the Oblivion\Data Folder. Every mod manager should be able to handle this file.. You can place the ini file in Data\, oder in Data\ini\ or feed it to hungry mudcrabs*, whatever you prefer. 
*Disclaimer: Feeding it to mudcrabs means you won't be able to change settings.

Activate the .esp in a game launcher of your choice.

This mod needs OBSE. 
If you want the summon spell to have a unique Icon, you'll need custom spell icons - updated.
