Skill Based Harvest Chance

A modifcation for Oblivion with patch 1.2.0416 by Laulajatar.
Requires OBSE
Version 1.0



Description
-----------

In vanilla Oblivion, every plant has a designated harvest chance. Many have a 80% chance with some being lower. 

This mod changes the harvest chance based on you Alchemy skill and your Luck.

Per default you get:
0.4% per point of Luck, like Luck works for other skills.
Alchemy 0-24 (Novice) - -15% chance
Alchemy 25-49 (Apprentice) - no modifier
Alchemy 50-74 (Journeyman) - +15% chance
Alchemy 75-99 (Expert) - +30% chance
Alchemy 100+ (Master) - +50% chance

Additionally, a master of Alchemy has a 10% chance to harvest a second ingredient.

This would mean that a Journeyman of Alchemy who has about 12 Luck will have a 100% chance of harvesting those common ingredients. A Master of Alchemy with Luck close too 100 will get a 70% harvest bonus which will allow them to harvest all vanilla plants 100% successfully (except for a few SI ones). I personally don't think that's too overpowered, but everything can be customized in the mod's ini file. 
A more fluid progression that allows constant calculation of your bonus instead of waiting for the next mastery level can be turned on in the ini file, too.

Nirnroots remain unchanged.

If Nehrim has plants, this should work for Nehrim too, as it has no master. 



Installation
------------

Copy the contents of the archive into the Oblivion\Data Folder. 
Activate the .esp in a game launcher of your choice.

This mod ABSOLUTELY needs OBSE. 

This mod will not store anything in your savegame, it can be uninstalled at every time.

Whatever, just give a small credit. If you use any of it, you should probably change the stupid internal names :p
