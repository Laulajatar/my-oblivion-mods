Show Map Markers
A modifcation for Oblivion with patch 1.2.0416 by Laulajatar.
Version 1.0

Description
-----------

Similar to the "Explorer" perk in Fallout games, this mod will mark all locations on your map. You will not be able to fast travel there until you visited them yourself once. 

By default, this happens on level 20. 

It will work for all worldspaces, Tamriel, SI and mod added ones. 
If new mods are installed later, those map markers will show up as well, if the conditions (= level 20, unless changed) are still met. 

By default, you will get a short message when new markers are added to your map. You can change that in the ini to no notification at all or to a more obvious message box. 
You can set the level on which the map markers should appear in the ini file as well. 

This mod supports LINK.



Installation
------------

Copy the contents of the archive into the Oblivion\Data Folder.
(For your own sanity, use a mod manager for this).
Activate the .esp in a game launcher of your choice.
Load order doesn't matter.



Uninstallation
--------------

You can just uninstall all the files at any time, but any map markers that were added by this mod will stay visible. 



Requirements
------------

OBSE or xOBSE
