Morrowind-like Fog

A modifcation for Oblivion with patch 1.2.0416 by Laulajatar.
Version 1.0
Requires OBSE


Description
-----------

This mod changes clip distance (= drawing of objects) and fog distance to look similar to Morrowind (Cliffracers not included).
Both settings can be changed independently. 

This mod supports LINK. 



Known Issues
------------

If the clip distance is enabled, you might need to restart the game after disabling it with LINK, since it's not possible to turn that setting truly off again. About 200000 or so is the highest you can set it to ingame while still seeing an effect. Probably doesn't matter that much, since the possible fog settings will be much closer. 



Installation
------------

Copy the contents of the archive into the Oblivion\Data Folder.
(For your own sanity, use a mod manager for this).
Activate the .esp in a game launcher of your choice.
Load order doesn't matter.
You can adjust the settings in the ini file, or use LINK.



Uninstallation
--------------

Can be uninstalled at any time. Next time the game is started, fog and clip distance will be back to normal.



Requirements
------------

OBSE or xOBSE
