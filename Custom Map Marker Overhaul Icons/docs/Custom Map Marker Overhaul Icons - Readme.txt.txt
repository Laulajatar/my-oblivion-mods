This isn't really a mod, it's just a file I edited for my game.

For me, the default icons of Map Marker Overhaul (any of them) have two issues:

The devs didn't add icons for the "marked on map but undiscovered & entered/cleared" state. Sure, it doesn't make sense to mark a dungeon as done that you haven't visited, but it is possible. And once you do that, the icon vanishes.
    The letters E and C for entered and cleared when tagging markers are super small on default DarNified UI settings and barely readable.

    I added the missing states, and instead of tagging the icons with small letters, I changed their color. For icons with different states depending on tags - dungeon icons like forts, Ayleid ruins, caves and camps - the default color is slightly greyed out. Entered - meant to be used with the tags strong enemy, too hard lock etc - will turn red. Once the dungeon is cleared, the color will turn to match the other, normal icons.

I also changed three of the custom map markers you can set. It's now a flag for general points of interest, a tower (I use them for Maskar's outposts), a merchant bag (I wanted to use it to mark if I have to drop loot somewhere) and the old Ayleid ruin icon. I'm not super happy with the latter, but I don't really have any better ideas atm anyway.

All credits for the original icons go to xythen for the borderless map icons and theNiceOne for Map Marker Overhaul.

Install: Make sure the texture ends up in your data folder, have archive invalidation, have Map Marker Overhaul, have texture size at large.
