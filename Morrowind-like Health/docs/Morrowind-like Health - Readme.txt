Description
-----------

This was a request on my other mod. 
This mod makes it so waiting no longer regenerates all health at once. It regenerates health by 10% Endurance per hour, like in Morrowind.
To change the heal %, open the console and enter: set MLHRestorePercent to *value from 0 - 100*
For example, for 20% Endurance per hour, set MLHRestorePercent to 20

If you're hardcore and only want to heal while really sleeping in a bed, open the console and enter: set MLHWaitingHeals to 0
Other than in Morrowind it is not possible to "sleep" in the Wilderness without a bed, though. I'd suggest a mod like Maskar's Camping.

Should work fine with Basic Primary Needs' health loss. I would not recommend sleeping while hungry/thirsty and low on health, however. Especially at a low endurance, the stat loss by BPN can outweigh the healing you recieve. 

Requires OBSE.
