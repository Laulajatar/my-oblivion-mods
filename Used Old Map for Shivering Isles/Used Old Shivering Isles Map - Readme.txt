Used Old Map for Shivering Isles


· - = | Description | = - ·

I've always used the Old Map or Improved Used Map for my Cyrodiil map and I was missing a similar option for the Shivering Isles, so I made one (or six).

Divided = Mania uses a lighter yellowish green, Dementia a dark vibrant green
Normal = All of the isles use the same color
Vanilla = No color

Technically none, but it doesn't make much sense to install a map for SI without SI, does it?

Pick one of the 6 options. Make sure the files from the archive of your choice end up in your Oblivion/Data folder. I would suggest using a mod manager.



· - = | Uninstallation | = - ·

Just remove the files that came with this mod (preferably by uninstalling with your mod manager).
