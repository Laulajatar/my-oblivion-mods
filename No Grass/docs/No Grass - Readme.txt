This mod removes the grass from the game - to be technical, it removes the grass entries from all landscape textures. So if you’re using any mods that add new ones, you’d have your grass back. But then you probably don’t need this mod in the first place.

I know this can easily be done on PC with other methods. The esp variant was made as an attempt for people modding on PS3.

Install like any other esp.
Can be added or removed at any time.
