Sinderion's Serendipity

A modifcation for Oblivion with patch 1.2.0416 by Laulajatar.
Version 1.0

 
Description
-----------

This is a silly little mod that adds a new reward to the quest Seeking your Roots. If you've managed to find & hand in 100 Nirnroots, you will acquire the perk "Sinderion's Serendipity" which gives a chance to create two potions instead of one when performing alchemy. 

The chance to get double potions is stored in the Global variable lSSDoublePotionChance, if you wanna tinker with it in xEdit.

The custom icon will not appear unless you are using Custom Spell Icons.
As of 1.1, it should no longer be necessary to edit the ini files, the icon will be applied automatically.



Known Issues
------------

To use this with Alchemy Advanced, the addon Alchemy Advanced Adjustments is needed. 
Please note that the added ability is a dummy, just for flavor. It has no effect, removing it does not remove the effect. The perk is added on game load, depending on if you've reached quest stage 100 of the Seeking your Roots quest or not.
