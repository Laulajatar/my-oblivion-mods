Simple Sunglare with Lens Flare

Description
-----------

This is just a simple retexture of the Oblivion sunglare. 
ENB has this amazing sunglare that appears when you look at the sun in certain angles, but I can't use ENB, so I tried to find myself a replacement. 

Unlike ENB:
- This one is static, it will always look the same.
- It will appear every time you look at the sun. The intensity depends on the weather.
- It will not work with (weather) mods that change the path to the climate's sun texture. 

I don't know of any mods beside NAO that do the latter, and the texutres have already been placed in a way that they work with both, vanilla and nao climate.



Installation
------------

Copy the contents of the archive into the Oblivion\Data Folder (you really should use a mod manager for this).
There is no Esp.



Uninstallation
--------------

Make sure the files that came with this mod are removed from your Oblivion\Data folder. 
That's why mod managers are nice. 



Requirements
------------

A working Archive Invalidation, for example SkyBSA.
